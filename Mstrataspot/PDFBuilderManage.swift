The inspection did not include breaking apart, dismantling, removing or moving any element of the building and items located on the common property.\n\nThe report does not and cannot make comment upon: defects that may have been concealed; the assessment of which may rely on certain weather conditions; the presence or absence of timber pests; gas fittings; heritage concerns; site drainage; security concerns; detection and identification of illegal building work; durability of exposed finishes; the roof space and under floor space.\n\nThe inspector will identify and assess hazards relating to the static condition of the common property and then recommend remedial action or the introduction of a suitable control measure.
